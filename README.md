There were times when I wish there is a quick painting app which only provide 
a few stoke and color option so I can quickly sketch an idea and share it with 
my friends.Hence I decided to start my monthly app challenge with this idea!!

Uses canvas and bitmap manipulation, as well as intent sharing to share your 
sketch idea through jpeg image!

Start coding this app in 24 hours, it has a usable bluetooth code inside. 
However, due to the flawness of the bluetooth device we own, we weren't 
able to have successful connection to our crap module. Nonetheless, during 
the development proccess I do manage to get it connected once and the 
partial code were able to receive sensor value from the module.

Getting tired of kept bombarded by ads in cpu-z and cpux, hence this 
idea was borned to make my own android system monitor 

This app will get information about cpu, sensor real time update and memory 
info. This application also implemented @roughike awesome 
bottom bar!

This is a collaborate project with my friends in NCTU, be sure to 
see the original [repo](https://github.com/w86763777/BikeLine) and give
him a star!!!

This app implment a complex fragment activity and mutiple layer service for
parsing the restaurant coordinate in the route you choose. 

Our plan is to enable people to share their route and showed it on map, 
hence people can try cycling the route and rate it according to their 
experience

## In order to get it running, you must :
Add your api key to string/api-keys.xml 
Add your api key to the key parameter in FindRestaurant.java


```
