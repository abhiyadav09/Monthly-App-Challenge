##  January

There were times when I wish there is a quick painting app which only provide 
a few stoke and color option so I can quickly sketch an idea and share it with 
my friends.Hence I decided to start my monthly app challenge with this idea!!

Uses canvas and bitmap manipulation, as well as intent sharing to share your 
sketch idea through jpeg image!

Finish this app in 24 hours, it has a usable bluetooth service with 
complete socket receiver. 
However, due to the flawness of the bluetooth device we own, we weren't 
able to have successful connection to our crap module. Nonetheless, during 
the development proccess I do manage to get it connected once and the 
partial code were able to receive sensor value from the module.

Getting tired of kept bombarded by ads in cpu-z and cpux, hence this 
idea was borned to make my own android system monitor 

This app will get information about cpu, sensor real time update and memory 
info. This application also implemented @roughike awesome 
bottom bar!

This is a collaborate project with my friends in NCTU, be sure to 
see the original [repo](https://github.com/w86763777/BikeLine) and give
him a star!!!

This app implment a complex fragment activity and mutiple layer service for
parsing the restaurant coordinate in the route you choose. 

Our plan is to enable people to share their route and showed it on map, 
hence people can try cycling the route and rate it according to their 
experience

## In order to get it running, you must :
Add your api key to string/api-keys.xml 
Add your api key to the key parameter in FindRestaurant.java

```

## May
```
  A Food delivery apps as my Android Course final projects, my team and I uses Stripe API for credit card transaction(demo)
  okHttp3 for parsing the existing restaurant list (This may not be working as you see this, as the API may no longer exist)
  Parse server provided by Back4app to handle incomming transaction records as well as interacting with Stripe API code.
```

#### Crap I was so busy working during my summer holiday and totally forgot about this challenge

## September

  Getting bit tired of kept seeing these crap google ads popping up on my nanopool monitoring apps,
  So I decided to write my own. Using OkHttp3 and nothing else

![Alt text](/img/unioninfo.png?raw=true )

```
   Rewritten NCTU student union fee checking app in native android development using Firebase backend 
   instead of previous Flask RESTful API. Much faster improvement in search speed, real time data 
   update, allows Facebook login and allows adding new student input. 
   
```
#### Setting up:
1. apply for facebook login at developer.facebook.com and replace the secret key and token at strings.xml inside resource directory
   <string name="facebook_app_id">----Facebook ID---</string>
   <string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">---Protocol Key---</string>
2. add your firebase google-service.json to the project and allow database function, authentication at your console.
3. for demo purpose a student_demo.json data is included in the project root. You can import it to your database to see the result.
